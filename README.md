# 3 Month Full-Stack Roadmap with Projects & Capstone
This is a Full-Stack Engineer roadmap created by ChatGPT. This roadmap includes what to learn, mini projects, a capstone project.



**Phase 1: Strengthening JavaScript Fundamentals (January 2 - January 31, 2024)**

1. **Task 1: JavaScript Basics**
   - *Goals of this Phase:*
      - Build a solid foundation in JavaScript syntax and concepts.
   - *Task Summary:* 
      - Complete interactive courses on platforms like freeCodeCamp or Codecademy.
      - **Mini-Project: Create a simple program solving a real-world problem.**
        - *Example:* Build a to-do list application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks.
        - *Brief Refresher:* Use variables, functions, and basic DOM manipulation to create a functional to-do list. Refresh your understanding of event listeners and basic HTML structure.

   - *Portfolio Project: Full-Stack Task Manager*
      - **Steps:**
        1. **Frontend Foundation:**
           - Create a simple HTML/CSS layout for the task manager interface.
           - Use your JavaScript skills to make the interface interactive with basic task addition and deletion.

        2. **Implement Basic Task Management:**
           - Use JavaScript to add, edit, and delete tasks on the front end.
           - Begin thinking about how these tasks will be sent to and received from the backend.

**Phase 2: Exploring JavaScript Frameworks (February 1 - February 29, 2024)**

1. **Task 1: Introduction to React**
   - *Goals of this Phase:*
      - Understand React fundamentals and component-based architecture.
   - *Task Summary:* 
      - Learn the basics of React through documentation and tutorials.
      - **Mini-Project: Build a simple React component.**
        - *Example:* Create a reusable button component with different styles and hover effects.
        - *Brief Refresher:* Use JSX to define the component, understand the component lifecycle, and manage the state within the component.

   - *Portfolio Project: Full-Stack Task Manager*
      - **Steps:**
        1. **Integrate React:**
           - Refactor the front end of your task manager to use React components.
           - Ensure that basic task management functionality is maintained.

        2. **State Management with React:**
           - Use React state to manage tasks within components.
           - Explore how state changes trigger re-renders and how to optimize this process.

**Phase 3: Full Stack Integration (March 1 - March 31, 2024)**

1. **Task 1: Server-Side Development**
   - *Goals of this Phase:*
      - Acquire skills in server-side development using Node.js and Express.
   - *Task Summary:* 
      - Learn Node.js and Express for server-side development.
      - **Mini-Project: Create a basic Node.js server.**
        - *Example:* Build a server that handles basic HTTP requests and returns a simple response.
        - *Brief Refresher:* Understand the Node.js runtime, create a basic Express application, and handle different routes.

   - *Portfolio Project: Full-Stack Task Manager*
      - **Steps:**
        1. **Connect Frontend to Backend:**
           - Modify your React components to communicate with the Node.js server.
           - Ensure that tasks created in the frontend are sent to and stored in the backend.

        2. **Implement Database Integration:**
           - Choose a database (e.g., MongoDB) and integrate it with your Node.js server.
           - Store tasks in the database and retrieve them dynamically.

**Capstone Project: April 1 - April 30, 2024**

- **Portfolio Project: Full-Stack Application**
   - *Goals of this Phase:*
      - Combine all knowledge into a cohesive full-stack application.
   - *Project Brief:* 
      - *Timeframe:* 4 weeks
      - *Requirements:* Full CRUD functionality, user authentication, database interactions, responsive design.
      - *Bonus Tasks:* Implement advanced features like search functionality.
